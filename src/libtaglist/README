libTagList 0.1 by Fredrik Rambris <fredrik@rambris.com>

This is a bunch of functions to handle TagLists. A taglist is an array of
Identifier- and Data-pairs like this:
ATTR_COLOR, 34,
ATTR_TITLE, (char *)"Test",
TAG_DONE

It is reverse engineered from AmigaOS. I've included the documentation from
AmigaOS and snipped out the irrelevant. Take a peek at taglist.txt.

I've not completed all functions. Two is still to do but I found them bad and
not very useful for me to code them. They are PackStructureTags and
UnpackStructureTags which use a packtable and stores/retrieves the values of a
taglist in/from a structure.

It not a real shared library. Just add it to your source tree and do what you
want. I don't care what happens with this and will not be held responsible for
anything happening. However. If you do use it, it would be cool if you told
the users (manual, homepage or whatever) that you're using it.
