* After getting nagged by Adam to release this version I made it ready for
  release.

* 1.2 released

Sun Jun 11 23:60  Fredrik Rambris <fredrik@rambris.com>
* Got a patch that fixed the warnings by Ondrejicka.

* Fooled around and got to understand a bit of autoconf. This resulted in that
  a spec-file is generated with version and prefix. NICE! I'm starting to like
  this thing. The fooling around resulted in a bunch of new warnings, though =)

* Rearranged the sourcetree a bit. Put the sources into src/, the PHP-version
  and sample.css into extras/. 

* config.h is renamed to defaults.h (and moved to src/) and a new config.h is
  generated by autoconf.

* After getting an auto-conf/make-ized gfxindex from
  Ondrejicka Stefan <ondrej@idata.sk> it compiles with -Wall (all warnings) and
  gives me a whole lot of warnings. I'm not able (given enough time would
  eventualy do it but I don't have that) to fix them. You folks have to live
  with the warnings until some nice fellow fixes them.

* Adam noticed that Parent didn't work when there only was one page. Fixed that.

* Got some reports from Francesco Zuliani <francesco.zuliani@ca.infn.it> that
  gfxindex coredumped when supplying titles and having a .gfxindex. While
  tracking I found some other unallocated memory. I finally found out that when
  gfxindex copies the current settings it just copied pointers to the strings
  and thus they were freed several times which ended up in a nice core dump.

* Francesco also wondered how he could have thumbnails for Prev and Next just
  like on the demo-page. That was done with an earlier version. I re-implemented
  it in this version (that is totally rewritten).

* 1.1 released

Mon May 01 23:33  Fredrik Rambris <fredrik@rambris.com>
* Got back the doc proofread by Adam and incorperated the changes.
  Time to do some uploading and announcing now...

* 1.0 released

Sun Apr 30 21:56  Fredrik Rambris <fredrik@rambris.com>
* Finished documentation and sent it of to Adam for some proofreading.

Mon Apr 24 22:04  Fredrik Rambris <fredrik.rambris@swipnet.se>
* Prepared gfxindex for release.

Tis Mar 28 03:24  Fredrik Rambris <fredrik.rambris@amiga.nu>
* The commandline parsing got screwed up. It's now only parsed once so the
  order of options have been changed:
  /etc, ~/, commandline, .thumbnails/, .gfxindex
* --nothumbs. Don't create any thumbnails
* JPEG Quality now works
* --nocredits Don't show credits


Mon Mar 20 00:24  Fredrik Rambris <fredrik.rambris@amiga.nu>
* After a bunch of mail from my betatester
  Adam Sleight <adams@linearcorp.com> with tons of information and
  information I've implemented a load of features.
  - Filenames can be removed ( -t / --notitles )
  - JPEG Quality selectable ( -Q / --quality )
  - The navbarstrings ( [ Previous | 1 | 2 | Next ] ) can be changed.
  - The path to a Cascading Stylesheet is now relative to the start-dir
    (a sample CSS is supplied so you can see what's possible). Two IDs are
    defined. navbar and credits.
  - The defaults have changed. Thumbnails are now 128x128 and is not padded
    by default. No fonts or colors are generated. Use bodyargs and/or CSS
    for that.
  - And the biggest of them all... config-files. All options can now be
    entered into a file. It's loaded in the following order:
    /etc/gfxindex, ~/.gfxindex, .thumbnails/gfxindex, .gfxindex
    Each have presendance over the previous. Use like this
    [longoption] = argument / true / false / yes / no
    examples
    BodyArgs = BGCOLOR="#888888"
    Quality = 60
    Title = My wedding
    Everything after the first '=' with spaces trimmed of the edges is
    considered argument.

* After hacking on this a couple of hours and not using old code I managed
  to get something usable. The first version with the two tools makethumbs
  and gfxindex integrated with recursing and all =). With imlib this gets
  very much quicker than the old one and you only have to issue a single
  command.

Sat Feb 19 19:46  Fredrik Rambris <fredrik.rambris@amiga.nu>

* Started from scratch yesterday. Now using popt for argument parsing, glib
  for portability and later on imlib and gdk for thumbnail processing. Fully
  self-contained! popt and directory reading is almost finished now. This is
  the development branch of 1.0. This will however mean that we utilize X so
  I think I'll have to make a GUI for it too.

Thu Feb 10 20:18  Fredrik Rambris <fredrik.rambris@amiga.nu>

* 0.4 released

* Marco Pratesi <pratesi@nausicaa.eln.uniroma2.it> reported to me that
  gfxindex coredumped when he used custom strings for next, space etc due
  to a too small buffer.

* I noticed a misspelling the lead to 'Too many open files'. It said
  close instead of fclose.

* Changed the license to be true Open Source

Thu Jan 06 18:25  Hans-Peter Bock <bocki@dwarf.wh.uni-stuttgart.de>

* I had problems with gfxindex and 60 pictures I wanted to make a
  gallery with.gfxindex always wrote hyperlinks to an indexfile which
  it didnt create, when i set xstop to 5 and ystop to 3 (60/(5*3)=4).
  (It made hyperlinks for index.html to index4.html but actually only
  created index.html to index3.html.)
