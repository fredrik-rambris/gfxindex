Mon Jul 19 22:22:36 2004  Fredrik Rambris  <fredrik@rambris.com>
* Jörg Zöllner <joerg.z.77@gmx.net> reported that directory traversing didn't
  work past one level down. That should be fixed now.

Wed Apr 07 17:44:27 2004  Fredrik Rambris  <fredrik@rambris.com>
* Another bug reported by Andrew Tait nailed down. The indexheaderfile etc
  files didn't quite work correct on Windows. Also if the file didn't end with
  a newline the last row was ignored.

* Added an option for outputting just the contents between <body> and </body>
  and not a full HTML document. Suggested by Andrew Tait. See --nofulldoc

* Added another option to allow for a flat directory structure. Right now it
  adds _tn to the thumbnails filename (like pc26534_tn.jpg) and links directly
  to the image instead of a HTML document. Also Andrew's suggestion See --flat

Mon Apr 05 15:11:00 2004  Fredrik Rambris  <fredrik@rambris.com>
* Fixed a typo in the docs. Thanx Andrew Tait <andrew@arduous.net>

Mon Feb 23 22:59:46 2004  Fredrik Rambris  <fredrik@rambris.com>
* Updated the documentation

* Enabled use of config files.

* Updated the Windows installer
  - Made the Windows installer create a default config file.

  - Added a context menu item in the Windows installer. You now can right
    click on a folder and choose "Create album with GFXIndex". The
	gfxindex.ini created when installing is used.

  - Added a finish page where the README can be brought up.

  - Added this ChangeLog to the docs-dir and also moved COPYING there.
	
* Fixed a bug where the absolute path would be put into HTML when using --dir

Thu Feb 12 11:38:17 2004  Fredrik Rambris  <fredrik@rambris.com>
* After a report by Kent <kf@nortas.com> that when recursing in Windows
  gfxindex outputs backslashes in the HTML. All HTML now runs through a
  function (myfprintf) that replaces all backslashes with normal slashes.

Sun Oct 05 01:16:35 2003  Fredrik Rambris  <fredrik@rambris.com>
* Stylesheets can now be embedded into the documents.

* Added option for inserting custom headers and footers (read in from file or
  supplied on command line/config)

* Added option to set custom title formats (using printf-style formating
  strings).

* Pictures and thumbnails now are in a CSS class (picture and thumbnails).

Mon Sep 29 00:21:02 2003  Fredrik Rambris  <fredrik@rambris.com>
* Fixed a bug (by adding parantheses around x and y in xytoff) that caused it
  to crash with some pictures.

* When loading JPEG images there was some garbage at the top on some machines.
  For some reason I added instead of overwriting the pixels when loading. That
  is now fixed.

Sun Sep 21 01:42:21 2003  Fredrik Rambris  <fredrik@rambris.com>
* Bumped to version 2.0
  Seems to me that so much has been rewritten and I skrewed up versioning in
  the past (Going from 1.0 to 1.4 on Amiga, continuing that serie for a while
  on Linux and then restarting from 1.1).

Sun Sep 07 20:32:25 2003  Fredrik Rambris  <fredrik@rambris.com>
* Added support for PNG (read only).
  And while doing this I moved the alpha channel into the im_pixels which now
  is stored as RGBA (Pixel-type). PNG supports this right of, I had to let the
  JPEG read into an intermediate buffer as it doesn't do RGBA.

* Fixed a bug which perhibited one to set the jpeg quality

* Added a second quality option that sets the quality of the bigs.

Fri Sep 05 22:33:24 2003  Fredrik Rambris  <fredrik@rambris.com>
* As expat converts everything to UTF-8 I made a quick'n'dirty converter back
  to Latin 1.

* Added an option to write an album.xml template.

Tue Sep 02 00:15:20 2003  Fredrik Rambris  <fredrik@rambris.com>
* Album caption and title read from album.xml

* EXIF information is now read
  If rotation is not set and it is in EXIF orientation tag it will be used.
  If your camera supports this (my moms Olympus C2100UZ does this when rotating
  the image in display mode) this info will make gfxindex rotate as selected in
  camera. Very useful. Anyway, a few selected tags are shown. I may be make
  them configurable someday. Windows binary is now 148k.

* Cachefile is now written
  It ment to be used mostly from PHP and is not read in yet. This doesn't use
  any xml library so it's available at all times. ExifInfo and config isn't
  written to it yet but some of it probably should be written.

* JPEG writing now make optimized, progressive files
  This reduces filesize by a few bytes and it tricks the viewer into beleiving
  that the loading is faster.
  
Sun Aug 31 23:45:26 2003  Fredrik Rambris  <fredrik@rambris.com>
* Rotation of images added.
  By using rotate="90" or whatever in the <Picture>-tag in album.xml one can
  now have GFXindex rotate the images on the fly. The actual rotating function
  isn't very good (it's late). Will improve it later on. I have thought of
  using GD instead of my own libgfx. That way I'd have a lot ready made.

* Captions to albums added
  It's not read from album.xml just yet but rather from command line.

Sat Aug 30 22:17:08 2003  Fredrik Rambris  <fredrik@rambris.com>
* Captions and titles can now be read from album.xml
  It's not configurable and due to the fact that I don't understand expat
  fully the captions must comform to XML. So all tags must be closed. But this
  can be acceptable, I think. By adding a skip="true" to the picture tag one
  can choose to skip certain pictures.

Sun Aug 24 23:46:51 2003  Fredrik Rambris  <fredrik@rambris.com>
* Switched to libexpat. Expat is much smaller but relies more on the work of
  the developer. But after using a crude stack I managed to get it tree-like
  again. Windows executable size is now 124k. I haven't really begun to insert
  the data into structs but I will next time. First out will be titles and
  captions for the pictures.

* I have created a variant of strcat and strncat that takes an additional
  argument that holds the maximum allows string size. When concatenating
  strings it will never overflow the destination string. It is a bit more
  expencive as it calls strlen a couple of times each time but I think it's
  worth it. I haven't implemented it in gfxindex.c yet.

Sun Aug 24 02:51:24 2003  Fredrik Rambris  <fredrik@rambris.com>
* Tried out libxml for the cache-file and later on picture titles and
  captions. Not entirely successful as it adds another dependency and the
  static executable size (Windows) went from 88k to 204k. Will make it optional
  at compile time but it definitly adds value to have it in. When under Linux
  you probably compile it as a dynamic executable as you've already have libxml
  installed already. Then you won't notice the overhead. The reason for using
  XML is because it's known by many and readable by PHP. I first thought of
  using a binary IFF-like format but then realized that PHP (and others) would
  have difficulties reading it. XML is the answer to everything when using B2B
  transactions and other obscure buzzwords.

* The "Bigs" as I call them, i.e. the scaled down versions of the original (-W)
  are now placed in THUMBDIR to minimize the clutter when not using an OUTDIR.

* Fixed a few bugs that revealed themselves when I made the above change.

* When there are both bigs and original available (in place or copied) it is
  put among the size-links.

Sun Aug 17 18:42:33 2003  Fredrik Rambris  <fredrik@rambris.com>
* gfxindex now produces valid HTML code
  By adding a DOCTYPE for Transitional HTML 4 and adding some ALTs to images
  that din't have one we get valid code.

* Links to subdirectories use first thumbnail of subdir.
  Still not configurable. Will do so later.

Thu Aug 14 23:58 2003  Fredrik Rambris  <fredrik@rambris.com>
* Links to subdirectories added
  It works but it's not configurable. When running in recursive mode the
  subdirectories gets prepended to the list of thumbnails and is put among the
  thumbnails as a simple link to the subdir. A thumbnail will be used in the
  future.

* Frontend begun
  I started crafting a GUI in Glade. It will be used as a model for GUIs on
  other platforms later. I probably will use it through libglade to keep code
  size down. The GUI is optional anyway.

Wed Aug 13 00:12 2003  Fredrik Rambris  <fredrik@rambris.com>
* Multiple output resolutions now configurable
  - I've added more config options for this. Default width selects which width
    the thumbnail should link to.
  - CSS class has been added to the widths

* --usetitles added
  This makes the pictures titles to be used instead of 'Prev' and 'Next' when
  viewing a picture.

* --copy added
  Copies the original image to outdir. Thus this option only makes a
  difference when outdir is set.

* Titles and noextensions reimplemented

* --remakethumbs and --remakebigs added
  This forces thumbs and/or the big pictures to be rendered again.

Sun Aug 10 2003 23:50  Fredrik Rambris <fredrik@rambris.com>
* Multiple output resolutions implemented.
  Now several output resolutions has been implemented. With -Wxxx,xxx,xxx you
  can set the sizes you want. Like -W1280,1024,800 will make the photos
  fit within a square of each size (1280x1280, 1024x1024 and 800x800). The
  output in HTML isn't quite polished but it works.

Sat Aug 09 2003 22:02  Fredrik Rambris <fredrik@rambris.com>
* Windows installer in place
  Played with Nullsofts installer system (NSIS). Just modified one of their
  examples and made an installer. Just 60kB of overhead. I find that nice. I
  also intend of creating packages for just about any unix distribution I can.
  Hopefully I will manage at least debian and gentoo.

* Outdir works
  It now outputs the files into outdir if it's set. It also copies the
  original image 
  
Tue Aug 05 2003 23:41  Fredrik Rambris <fredrik@rambris.com>
* Removed glib dependency.
  This made the whole thing segfault. After some nailing, it worked again.

* Cross-compiled it for Windows (mingw32)
  This presented some odd link and compile errors. I managed to overcome them
  and made a build-script (as the configure-script doesn't really work for
  that I think) that produces a single static executable. It also strips and
  UPX packs it afterwards. Final executable size: 79872. Not bad considered
  that the ordinary dynamic linux elf executable is 36448 (19866 packed).
  Once I get rid of popt I think I can trim it down further as popt uses
  libintl and libiconv. Some custom command line parser has to be written
  anyway if I am to port it back to Amiga (w/o a posix layer). The next thing
  to do here is an installer. I'll probably use the one from Nullsoft.

* If it finds an existing thumbnail it now reads in it's properties.
  I do this because I haven't re-implemented the cache file yet.

Fri Aug 01 2003 23:15  Fredrik Rambris <fredrik@rambris.com>
* Changed the credits string.

* Changed the so the credits aren't shown by default. The meta-tag is always
  inserted.

Thu Jul 31 2003 23:23  Fredrik Rambris <fredrik@rambris.com>
* Added a bunch of linked list utility functions. I even made a stupid bubble-
  sort function. I was a amazed that I got it to work even though it was late
  at night and it was a while since I toyed with linked lists manually like
  this.

* Now creates a list of the pictures it creates thumbnails. A new format is
  used. Now a list of struct Picture (w,h and path) is in it. One for the
  original, one for the thumbnail and one for each scaled down large picture
  (not used yet).

* I hacked on gfxindex() and made it work with the new linked list of pictures

Sun Jul 27 2003 17:11  Fredrik Rambris <fredrik@rambris.com>
Almost two years since I last poked on this. Anyhow work has comenced yet
again. And this is what I've done so far.

* Started to remove glib dependency. As glib nowdays is rather large and not
  very standard on Amiga or Windows I decided to ditch it as I didn't use much
  of it. I have gotten myself a compiler for Windows and since all of our
  family members have a digital camera and it's just me that run Linux I will
  try to port it to Windows as well as backport it to Amiga (just for fun).
  Then I want to try creating a GUI for it.

* Tested out the scaling of libjpeg (setting a ratio before loading and let the
  library do some scaling by skipping some DCT and stuff. It is near identical
  with loading the full image and then scaling it down but the speed is
  blazing. I've added what ratio to use that gets us closest to the final size
  and then scales the rest. Ratios that jpeglib supports is 1/1, 1/2, 1/4 and
  1/8.

* Björns scaling routine doesn't work as it should so I have set the gd one as
  standard. By using jpeglib scaling before bicubic scaling it's quite fast
  anyway. Will probably through out Björns routine.

* I've added a lot of comments and documentation (see HACKING). I noticed when
  I was to enter the matrix once again I was lost. Took me a while to get into
  the code again.

Sun Jul 29 2001 17:34  Fredrik Rambris <fredrik@rambris.com>
* PNG turned out to be a bit hard to understand for me in the middle of the
  night. I have started to implement the exif-reader from PHP. It's a modified
  version of jhead and seem to work fine.

Tue Jul 17 2001 03:44  Fredrik Rambris <fredrik@rambris.com>
* Made some preliminary preparing to implement PNG-I/O and then decided to hit
  the bed. Hopefully will we have full PNG support in some time. I hope that
  PNG is just as easy to implement as JPEG. I will also implement libppm
  (netpbm) and use external readers for the rest of the file formats. GIF and
  TIFF might be implemented later on as there are some nice libraries for them.

Tue Jul 17 2001 01:21  Fredrik Rambris <fredrik@rambris.com>
* Finished implementing the new ConfArgs so that the whole program uses it's
  structures. I bet there are a few bugs left but I'll rince them out =)...

Mon Jul 16 2001 03:04  Fredrik Rambris <fredrik@rambris.com>
  Made a lot of changes w/o typing in this file... will try to remember all
  the changes now.
* Split up the function makethumbnails in two functions now smarter and easier
  to understand. It's now traverse and makethumbnail. Traverse just goes
  through the dirs (and will eventually read configurations etc) and it calls
  makethumbnail for every imagefile it understands (currently JPEGs)

* Decided to through away the cache stuff for now (the files.db) will
  reimplement it later because it is used in the PHP-script... I experimented
  with XML and a few other fileformats but I didn't find one that I liked. The
  internal structure (thumbdata) will also be changed soon (I have already
  written parts of it but haven't inserted it in the tree yet) to accomodate
  all the new (future) features such as comments, captions, EXIF and multiple
  sizes of origianl picture (like linuxart) 

* Have implemented a combined way of loading options and arguments from both
  the command line and configuration files. This however ment that a few
  options changed and more will change. It's named ConfArgs.

* A lot of restructuring that doesn't show from the users standpoint but will
  ease the expansion of gfxindex.

* It's beginning to get complicated for the user. An external GUI for the
  thing seem to be needed.

Wed Jun 27 2001 23:03  Fredrik Rambris <fredrik@rambris.com>
* While waiting for Björn to get the scalingroutine ready I've ripped the one
  used in GD 2.01. A floating-point function that gives very good results but
  is slow as hell. Activate it by giving a -f or --scalefine.

Mon Jun 25 2001 15:48  Fredrik Rambris <fredrik@rambris.com>
* Fixed some bugs in libgfx. I haven't really tested the opacity thing and
  since Björn demanded that he needed 32-bits unsigned for the colors and I
  forgot that I use -1 to indicate "leave this channel alone" things got
  messy. I've removed that feature for now. Will introduce it later as Björn
  uses another array of variables now and can mess around as he likes.

* For those of you actually taking time to read this text I must say that I
  chose to delay the release of 1.3 until it was fully usable (which it isn't
  at the current time of writing... messy tempus). The 1.2 have limitations
  but really do work. And the users will, I'm sure, appreciate the hours I've
  spent on this version. It has ment rearraning the sources quite a bit.

Mon Jun 18 2001 02:00  Fredrik Rambris <fredrik@rambris.com>
* Started adding stuff for the backport to Amiga. Um. Yes. I have decided that
  since I started this project on my Amiga I may aswell make it work there
  again. I encourage users to make it work under Win32.

Sat Jun 16 2001 23:52  Fredrik Rambris <fredrik@rambris.com>
* Added a slightly better scaling routine made by my friend
  Björn Östberg <jetracer@swipnet.se>. It reads the samples weighted (some
  call it anti-aliased reading) which is more accurate. It is under
  construction (Björn has made it in AMOS Basic (on Amiga) before with success
  and is now implementing it in C) and will be improved to read and average
  the whole area that gets scaled down. It is made in fixed point calculations
  which gives a fairly accurate result and blazing speed.

* While changing around from signed integer to unsigned to have more accuracy
  in the new scaling routine I broke some stuff in my gfxlib and it took me
  a while before I realized that and fixed it. It is fixed now anyhow.

* Moved all files for gfxlib to a subdir

* Added HTML padding with HSPACE and VSPACE when image padding is off.

* Made code to remove the extensions from filenames in indexes. Will make it
  configurable soon.

Fri Jun 15 2001 08:02  Fredrik Rambris <fredrik@rambris.com>
* Removed my email addy from the credits line. Got too many mails asking me
  about the pictures in the page. Also the link to gfxindex homepage is opened
  in a new window.

* Altered all the ID= to CLASS= for the stylesheeting.

Sun Jun 10 2001 23:27  Fredrik Rambris <fredrik@rambris.com>
* While rearranging the source I messed up it a bit and it coredumped. It took
  me a while to pin it down.

* Learnt how to use gdb. Added a --enable-debug option to the configure script
  which tells gcc to add debug symbols to the executable.

* Altered the spec file to create RPMs with stripped, smaller executable.

Sat Jun 09 2001 22:39  Fredrik Rambris <fredrik@rambris.com>
* Added my libtaglist to the source tree (was harder than I thought but I
  managed). libtaglist allows me to have optional arguments to the gfxlib,
  like JPEG quality etc. which was the first thing I changed. So now JPEG
  quality can be set again.

* Rearranged a bit.

* Read up on libjpeg and scale on the fly and I'm not convinced that it is
  really done, the speed difference is not big between this and older
  versions.

* Made room for arbitary data (like comments, EXIF data etc in the image
  structure in gfxlib.

Mon Jun 04 2001 22:59  Fredrik Rambris <fredrik@rambris.com>
  Made some profiling and found out that the longest time is spent when loading
  the image (only JPEGs tested ofcause). libjpeg supports downscaling on the
  fly (the file format allows that). Will try to use that as well as loading
  several lines at the time.

Mon Mar 28 2001 01:55  Fredrik Rambris <fredrik@rambris.com>
  It's been QUITE a while since I typed in this file, meaning making some
  changes to the sourcetree. The changelog doesn't say I released 1.2 which I
  did. Since then I did the stuff below and it didn't work right away, I lost
  interest and the project froze. Today I couldn't get myself to sleep (have to
  get up tomorrow) because I've only been awake approx 10 hours. So I decided
  to go through my Coding directory and see if there was something to do. I
  poked a bit on some other things that didn't quite compile and my eyes fell on
  this one. It sure compiled but didn't save any thumbnails. After hacking
  around a bit inserting a bunch of printfs to see what went wrong (that's my
  idea of debugging as I haven't figured out gdb yet) I saw that I had forgotten
  to put a ! before a strcmp. After I did it saved jpegs. A bit out of shape but
  still. Fixed the small glitches to make it kind of work and now I'm getting
  where I wanted... sleepy =)

So to the changes made so far:

* X dependancy completly removed. This is done with a custommade
  graphics.library (yes, I am and always will be an Amiga fanatic). This
  results in lower speed (haven't nailed it down yet) and larger executable.
  Some JPEG options probably don't work. It's been so long since I looked at
  the sources.
  
Sun Jun 11 23:60  Fredrik Rambris <fredrik@rambris.com>
* Got a patch that fixed the warnings by Ondrejicka.

* Fooled around and got to understand a bit of autoconf. This resulted in that
  a spec-file is generated with version and prefix. NICE! I'm starting to like
  this thing. The fooling around resulted in a bunch of new warnings, though =)

* Rearranged the sourcetree a bit. Put the sources into src/, the PHP-version
  and sample.css into extras/. 

* config.h is renamed to defaults.h (and moved to src/) and a new config.h is
  generated by autoconf.
  
* 1.2 released

Fre Jun 02 14:14  Fredrik Rambris <fredrik@rambris.com>
* After getting an auto-conf/make-ized gfxindex from
  Ondrejicka Stefan <ondrej@idata.sk> it compiles with -Wall (all warnings) and
  gives me a whole lot of warnings. I'm not able (given enough time would
  eventualy do it but I don't have that) to fix them. You folks have to live
  with the warnings until some nice fellow fixes them.

* Adam noticed that Parent didn't work when there only was one page. Fixed that.

Sat May 06 18:08  Fredrik Rambris <fredrik@rambris.com>
* Got some reports from Francesco Zuliani <francesco.zuliani@ca.infn.it> that
  gfxindex coredumped when supplying titles and having a .gfxindex. While
  tracking I found some other unallocated memory. I finally found out that when
  gfxindex copies the current settings it just copied pointers to the strings
  and thus they were freed several times which ended up in a nice core dump.

* Francesco also wondered how he could have thumbnails for Prev and Next just
  like on the demo-page. That was done with an earlier version. I re-implemented
  it in this version (that is totally rewritten).

* 1.1 released

Mon May 01 23:33  Fredrik Rambris <fredrik@rambris.com>
* Got back the doc proofread by Adam and incorperated the changes.
  Time to do some uploading and announcing now...

* 1.0 released

Sun Apr 30 21:56  Fredrik Rambris <fredrik@rambris.com>
* Finished documentation and sent it of to Adam for some proofreading.

Mon Apr 24 22:04  Fredrik Rambris <fredrik.rambris@swipnet.se>
* Prepared gfxindex for release.

Tis Mar 28 03:24  Fredrik Rambris <fredrik.rambris@amiga.nu>
* The commandline parsing got screwed up. It's now only parsed once so the
  order of options have been changed:
  /etc, ~/, commandline, .thumbnails/, .gfxindex
* --nothumbs. Don't create any thumbnails
* JPEG Quality now works
* --nocredits Don't show credits


Mon Mar 20 00:24  Fredrik Rambris <fredrik.rambris@amiga.nu>
* After a bunch of mail from my betatester
  Adam Sleight <adams@linearcorp.com> with tons of information and
  information I've implemented a load of features.
  - Filenames can be removed ( -t / --notitles )
  - JPEG Quality selectable ( -Q / --quality )
  - The navbarstrings ( [ Previous | 1 | 2 | Next ] ) can be changed.
  - The path to a Cascading Stylesheet is now relative to the start-dir
    (a sample CSS is supplied so you can see what's possible). Two IDs are
    defined. navbar and credits.
  - The defaults have changed. Thumbnails are now 128x128 and is not padded
    by default. No fonts or colors are generated. Use bodyargs and/or CSS
    for that.
  - And the biggest of them all... config-files. All options can now be
    entered into a file. It's loaded in the following order:
    /etc/gfxindex, ~/.gfxindex, .thumbnails/gfxindex, .gfxindex
    Each have presendance over the previous. Use like this
    [longoption] = argument / true / false / yes / no
    examples
    BodyArgs = BGCOLOR="#888888"
    Quality = 60
    Title = My wedding
    Everything after the first '=' with spaces trimmed of the edges is
    considered argument.

Sun Mar 19 02:28  Fredrik Rambris <fredrik.rambris@amiga.nu>

* After hacking on this a couple of hours and not using old code I managed
  to get something usable. The first version with the two tools makethumbs
  and gfxindex integrated with recursing and all =). With imlib this gets
  very much quicker than the old one and you only have to issue a single
  command.

Sat Feb 19 19:46  Fredrik Rambris <fredrik.rambris@amiga.nu>

* Started from scratch yesterday. Now using popt for argument parsing, glib
  for portability and later on imlib and gdk for thumbnail processing. Fully
  self-contained! popt and directory reading is almost finished now. This is
  the development branch of 1.0. This will however mean that we utilize X so
  I think I'll have to make a GUI for it too.

Thu Feb 10 20:18  Fredrik Rambris <fredrik.rambris@amiga.nu>

* 0.4 released

* Marco Pratesi <pratesi@nausicaa.eln.uniroma2.it> reported to me that
  gfxindex coredumped when he used custom strings for next, space etc due
  to a too small buffer.

* I noticed a misspelling the lead to 'Too many open files'. It said
  close instead of fclose.

* Changed the license to be true Open Source

Thu Jan 06 18:25  Hans-Peter Bock <bocki@dwarf.wh.uni-stuttgart.de>

* I had problems with gfxindex and 60 pictures I wanted to make a
  gallery with.gfxindex always wrote hyperlinks to an indexfile which
  it didnt create, when i set xstop to 5 and ystop to 3 (60/(5*3)=4).
  (It made hyperlinks for index.html to index4.html but actually only
  created index.html to index3.html.)
