* Started adding stuff for the backport to Amiga. Um. Yes. I have decided that
  since I started this project on my Amiga I may aswell make it work there
  again. I encourage users to make it work under Win32.

* Added a slightly better scaling routine made by my friend
  Björn Östberg <jetracer@swipnet.se>. It reads the samples weighted (some
  call it anti-aliased reading) which is more accurate. It is under
  construction (Björn has made it in AMOS Basic (on Amiga) before with success
  and is now implementing it in C) and will be improved to read and average
  the whole area that gets scaled down. It is made in fixed point calculations
  which gives a fairly accurate result and blazing speed.

* While changing around from signed integer to unsigned to have more accuracy
  in the new scaling routine I broke some stuff in my gfxlib and it took me
  a while before I realized that and fixed it. It is fixed now anyhow.

* Moved all files for gfxlib to a subdir

* Added HTML padding with HSPACE and VSPACE when image padding is off.

* Made code to remove the extensions from filenames in indexes. Will make it
  configurable soon.

* Removed my email addy from the credits line. Got too many mails asking me
  about the pictures in the page. Also the link to gfxindex homepage is opened
  in a new window.

* Altered all the ID= to CLASS= for the stylesheeting.

* While rearranging the source I messed up it a bit and it coredumped. It took
  me a while to pin it down.

* Learnt how to use gdb. Added a --enable-debug option to the configure script
  which tells gcc to add debug symbols to the executable.

* Altered the spec file to create RPMs with stripped, smaller executable.

Sat Jun 09 2001 22:39  Fredrik Rambris <fredrik@rambris.com>
* Added my libtaglist to the source tree (was harder than I thought but I
  managed). libtaglist allows me to have optional arguments to the gfxlib,
  like JPEG quality etc. which was the first thing I changed. So now JPEG
  quality can be set again.

* Rearranged a bit.

* Read up on libjpeg and scale on the fly and I'm not convinced that it is
  really done, the speed difference is not big between this and older
  versions.

* Made room for arbitary data (like comments, EXIF data etc in the image
  structure in gfxlib.

Mon Jun 04 2001 22:59  Fredrik Rambris <fredrik@rambris.com>
  Made some profiling and found out that the longest time is spent when loading
  the image (only JPEGs tested ofcause). libjpeg supports downscaling on the
  fly (the file format allows that). Will try to use that as well as loading
  several lines at the time.

  It's been QUITE a while since I typed in this file, meaning making some
  changes to the sourcetree. The changelog doesn't say I released 1.2 which I
  did. Since then I did the stuff below and it didn't work right away, I lost
  interest and the project froze. Today I couldn't get myself to sleep (have to
  get up tomorrow) because I've only been awake approx 10 hours. So I decided
  to go through my Coding directory and see if there was something to do. I
  poked a bit on some other things that didn't quite compile and my eyes fell on
  this one. It sure compiled but didn't save any thumbnails. After hacking
  around a bit inserting a bunch of printfs to see what went wrong (that's my
  idea of debugging as I haven't figured out gdb yet) I saw that I had forgotten
  to put a ! before a strcmp. After I did it saved jpegs. A bit out of shape but
  still. Fixed the small glitches to make it kind of work and now I'm getting
  where I wanted... sleepy =)

So to the changes made so far:

* X dependancy completly removed. This is done with a custommade
  graphics.library (yes, I am and always will be an Amiga fanatic). This
  results in lower speed (haven't nailed it down yet) and larger executable.
  Some JPEG options probably don't work. It's been so long since I looked at
  the sources.

Sun Jun 11 23:60  Fredrik Rambris <fredrik@rambris.com>
* Got a patch that fixed the warnings by Ondrejicka.

* Fooled around and got to understand a bit of autoconf. This resulted in that
  a spec-file is generated with version and prefix. NICE! I'm starting to like
  this thing. The fooling around resulted in a bunch of new warnings, though =)

* Rearranged the sourcetree a bit. Put the sources into src/, the PHP-version
  and sample.css into extras/. 

* config.h is renamed to defaults.h (and moved to src/) and a new config.h is
  generated by autoconf.

* After getting an auto-conf/make-ized gfxindex from
  Ondrejicka Stefan <ondrej@idata.sk> it compiles with -Wall (all warnings) and
  gives me a whole lot of warnings. I'm not able (given enough time would
  eventualy do it but I don't have that) to fix them. You folks have to live
  with the warnings until some nice fellow fixes them.

* Adam noticed that Parent didn't work when there only was one page. Fixed that.

Sat May 06 18:08  Fredrik Rambris <fredrik@rambris.com>
* Got some reports from Francesco Zuliani <francesco.zuliani@ca.infn.it> that
  gfxindex coredumped when supplying titles and having a .gfxindex. While
  tracking I found some other unallocated memory. I finally found out that when
  gfxindex copies the current settings it just copied pointers to the strings
  and thus they were freed several times which ended up in a nice core dump.

* Francesco also wondered how he could have thumbnails for Prev and Next just
  like on the demo-page. That was done with an earlier version. I re-implemented
  it in this version (that is totally rewritten).

* 1.1 released

Mon May 01 23:33  Fredrik Rambris <fredrik@rambris.com>
* Got back the doc proofread by Adam and incorperated the changes.
  Time to do some uploading and announcing now...

* 1.0 released

Sun Apr 30 21:56  Fredrik Rambris <fredrik@rambris.com>
* Finished documentation and sent it of to Adam for some proofreading.

Mon Apr 24 22:04  Fredrik Rambris <fredrik.rambris@swipnet.se>
* Prepared gfxindex for release.

Tis Mar 28 03:24  Fredrik Rambris <fredrik.rambris@amiga.nu>
* The commandline parsing got screwed up. It's now only parsed once so the
  order of options have been changed:
  /etc, ~/, commandline, .thumbnails/, .gfxindex
* --nothumbs. Don't create any thumbnails
* JPEG Quality now works
* --nocredits Don't show credits


Mon Mar 20 00:24  Fredrik Rambris <fredrik.rambris@amiga.nu>
* After a bunch of mail from my betatester
  Adam Sleight <adams@linearcorp.com> with tons of information and
  information I've implemented a load of features.
  - Filenames can be removed ( -t / --notitles )
  - JPEG Quality selectable ( -Q / --quality )
  - The navbarstrings ( [ Previous | 1 | 2 | Next ] ) can be changed.
  - The path to a Cascading Stylesheet is now relative to the start-dir
    (a sample CSS is supplied so you can see what's possible). Two IDs are
    defined. navbar and credits.
  - The defaults have changed. Thumbnails are now 128x128 and is not padded
    by default. No fonts or colors are generated. Use bodyargs and/or CSS
    for that.
  - And the biggest of them all... config-files. All options can now be
    entered into a file. It's loaded in the following order:
    /etc/gfxindex, ~/.gfxindex, .thumbnails/gfxindex, .gfxindex
    Each have presendance over the previous. Use like this
    [longoption] = argument / true / false / yes / no
    examples
    BodyArgs = BGCOLOR="#888888"
    Quality = 60
    Title = My wedding
    Everything after the first '=' with spaces trimmed of the edges is
    considered argument.

* After hacking on this a couple of hours and not using old code I managed
  to get something usable. The first version with the two tools makethumbs
  and gfxindex integrated with recursing and all =). With imlib this gets
  very much quicker than the old one and you only have to issue a single
  command.

Sat Feb 19 19:46  Fredrik Rambris <fredrik.rambris@amiga.nu>

* Started from scratch yesterday. Now using popt for argument parsing, glib
  for portability and later on imlib and gdk for thumbnail processing. Fully
  self-contained! popt and directory reading is almost finished now. This is
  the development branch of 1.0. This will however mean that we utilize X so
  I think I'll have to make a GUI for it too.

Thu Feb 10 20:18  Fredrik Rambris <fredrik.rambris@amiga.nu>

* 0.4 released

* Marco Pratesi <pratesi@nausicaa.eln.uniroma2.it> reported to me that
  gfxindex coredumped when he used custom strings for next, space etc due
  to a too small buffer.

* I noticed a misspelling the lead to 'Too many open files'. It said
  close instead of fclose.

* Changed the license to be true Open Source

Thu Jan 06 18:25  Hans-Peter Bock <bocki@dwarf.wh.uni-stuttgart.de>

* I had problems with gfxindex and 60 pictures I wanted to make a
  gallery with.gfxindex always wrote hyperlinks to an indexfile which
  it didnt create, when i set xstop to 5 and ystop to 3 (60/(5*3)=4).
  (It made hyperlinks for index.html to index4.html but actually only
  created index.html to index3.html.)
