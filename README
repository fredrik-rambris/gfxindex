   GFXindex - Thumbnailer and indexer
     _________________________________________________________________
   
  General Information
  
   GFXIndex is a tool to manage your picture collection by creating
   thumbnails (small representation of the original picture) and
   HTML-indexes.
   
   The thumbnails are by default put in the directory.thumbnails and the
   indices in the same directory as the images.
   
   There is also an indexer made in PHP for use directly on the web.
   
   The official web site is:
   [1]http://fredrik.rambris.com/gfxindex/
   
   The current project maintainer is Fredrik Rambris
   <[2]fredrik@rambris.com>.
   
  Requirements
  
     * [3]glib v1.2.x and gdk
     * [4]popt
     * [5]imlib
       
   And their requirements. Unfortunately this means that you have to have
   X running.
   
  Installation
  
   Nothing fancy here, folks.
   Edit src/defaults.h if you want to change some of the compiled in
   defaults.
  ./configure
  make
  make install    (as root)

  Usage
  
   The most common usage is to run GFXIndex within the directory you wish
   to make HTML indexes.
   
   Arguments can be entered on the commandline or be written to a
   runcontrol file. Runcontrol files can be /etc/gfxindex,
   $HOME/.gfxindex, ./.gfxindex, ./.thumbnails/gfxindex
   
   ./ means the current working directory. If using the recursive option
   it will be relative to each and every directory tranversed. The parent
   options are kept when parsing the new options. Try setting wide
   settings such as background color and css, etc. in the directory base
   directory and title in each and every directory.
   
   The options are pretty self-expanatory but I'll go ahead and explain
   them anyway.
   
   For the commandline options see gfxindex --help. This is the format of
   a rcfile.
   
   A rcfile is a regular text file. You may comment out the rest of the
   line with //. Each line consists of an option and a value separated by
   a '='. The formating is pretty liberal. After cutting the line by the
   first '=', whitespaces are stripped off. All chars are allowed except
   newline or carrige return.
   
   The name of the options are case insensitive.
   
   There are three types of values: String, integer and boolean.
   
   Boolean is true or false. Anything beginning with 0, f or n is false
   and anything beginning with 1, t or y is true.
   
   A string is a sequence of alphanumeric characters much like the ones
   you're reading right now. In the rcfile you don't enclose them in
   quotes as you do on the command line.
   
   An integer is simply a number
   
   An example:
   
// A nice configfile

Title     = My vacation on Mars
Recursive = Yes
Quality   = 90 // JPEG quality of thumbs
// EOF

   Available options are:
   
   QUIET (BOOL)
          Print progress information or not
          
   DIR (STRING)Directory to start with
          
   MAKETHUMBS (BOOL)
          Create thumbnails or not
          
   OVERWRITE (BOOL)
          Overwrite indices and thumbnails.
          
   RECURSIVE (BOOL)
          Dive into each directory.
          
   Padded thumbnail PAD (BOOL)
          Pad all thumbnails to equal size.
          
   THUMBWIDTH & THUMBHEIGHT (INTEGER)
          Sets the width and height of the thumbnails. The image is
          scaled poportionally so the final thumbnail may not have the
          proportions you set unless it's padded (see pad)
          
   QUALITY (INTEGER)
          Sets the JPEG quality for the thumbnails. 0 means poor and 100
          means best quality and vice versa with the compression ratio /
          file size.
          
   THUMBBGCOLOR (STRING)
          Sets the color of the background plate when rendering
          thumbnails. Only visible when rendering transparent images and
          when padding is active.
          
   Beveled thumbnail THUMBBEVEL (BOOL)
          Draws beveled frames around the image and the thumb. Selecting
          this silently activates padding.
          
   BEVELBG (STRING)
          Sets the color of the frame around the image when beveled
          
   BEVELBRIGHT & BEVELDARK (STRING)
          Sets the colors of the bright and dark edges that make up the
          bevel effect. It's a good idea to set them to a blend of
          BEVELBG.
          
   INDEXES (BOOL)
          If HTML-indexes are to be created or not. One reason for not
          creating them is if you, for instance, use the PHP-version of
          GFXIndex.
          
   CREDITS (BOOL)
          Whether or not to show the credits line in the bottom of the
          generated HTML-files. You're asked not to do this ;-).
          
   TITLES (BOOL)
          Whether or not to show the filenames under the thumbnails. Most
          digital cameras generate non-interesting filenames and
          therefore it doesn't make much sense showing them.
          
   NUMLINK (BOOL)
          Show numbered links to each page. [ 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 ]
          
   [thumbs.gif] THUMBSCALE (INTEGER)
          Use thumbnails for Prev and Next when viewing an image. Supply
          a percentage of the original thumbnail size it will have.
          100 sets the sizes of these thumbnails to the same as the other
          thumbnails, 50 half, etc.
          Set this to 0 and it will turn this feature off (default).
          
   NUMX & NUMY (INTEGER)
          Number of thumbnails per row and rows per page.
          An example, if I may:
          
NUMX = 16 // Sixteen thumbnails per row
NUMY = 8 // Eight rows per page

   BODYARGS (STRING)
          Arguments to put into the <BODY>-tag. Try this:
          
BODYARGS = BGCOLOR="#000000" TEXT="#ffffff" LINK="#ff8800" VLINK="#ff8800" ALIN
K="#ffff00"

   CELLARGS (STRING)
          Arguments for the <TD>-tag
          
   CSS (STRING)
          Path to a [6]Cascading Style Sheet relative to the starting
          directory. Another good guide to CSS is [7]richinstyle.com
          
   PARENTDOC (STRING)
          The link used when referring to the parent document. Only makes
          sense to use without recursing enabled. For instance, if you
          are on a IIS web server (shame on you) and want to link to
          ../default.asp instead of ../index.html you should use this
          option.
          
   LEFT, SPACE, DIVIDER, RIGHT, PREV, NEXT, INDEX and PARENT (STRING)
          Strings that make up the navigation bar.
          
   [   Prev   |   Parent   |   Index   |   Next   ]
   LEFT SPACE PREV SPACE DIVIDER SPACE PARENT SPACE DIVIDER SPACE INDEX
   SPACE DIVIDER SPACE NEXT SPACE RIGHT
   
          Set one of these to nothing (empty quotes "") and it will not
          be printed. A note about INDEX. The image is also links back to
          the index.
          
   TITLE (STRING)
          Title of the index.
          
   The best way to learn a program still is to experiment. It's also the
   perfect excuse for a developer to write poor documentation =).
   
  Future
  
     * Bugs?! You must be joking! ;-)
     * I'm experimenting with some GUI (GTK+) programming and maybe I'll
       make a image organizer with the capabilities of GFXIndex.
     * Your sumbissions will be implemented if they are within my vision
       or if you're persuasive enough.
