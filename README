This is a small program that generates indices of your pictures by creating
thumbnails (mini versions of the pictures) and a set of HTML-files. It's
somewhat configurable.

Installation:
make
(go root)
make install

The usage is simple

Thumbnail-creation:
Change to the directory of your pictures
Type makethumbs

Arguments is as follows:
-size <n>		: the size of the thumbs
-bgcolor <black|white>	: the color behind the picture
-background <file>	: or a background pixmap
-slide			: alternative look of the thumbs. Like slides


Index-creation:
In the same directory type gfxindex <title>
f.ex. gfxindex "Vacation in Florida"
type gfxindex -h for the arguments.
