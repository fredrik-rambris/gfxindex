About GFXIndex.c
----------------

This is the last version of GFXIndex I made on Amiga before moving to Linux
and x86 boxes. It relies on gfxcon (http://www.aminet.net/gfx/conv/gfxcon.lha)
to create the thumbnails (it's run from within gfxindex) and it must be called
c:gfxcon or change the source and recompile. I doesn't have a GUI nor is
startable from Workbench.

It has a different version scheme than we have today. In those days it was
common to start with 1.0 and go from there. This is thus the third version.

It was compiled with StormC.
