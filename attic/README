This is the GFXIndex-attic. Here's the really old version that is just fun to
look at. We have the last Amiga version (both source and compiled) and the last
of the Linux version based on that.

There are some elements left from those versions in the current source but very
much has been rewritten and modified.

Somewhere on the line the version scheme was changed. Back when I first
created GFXIndex om my Amiga 1200 it was customary that the first version
of a program was 1.0 and the next 1.1 and so on. But one day I changed the
that so some versions have the same number and the whole version history
doesn't make much sense. But just consider 1.0 to 1.6 to 0.1. The 0.2-0.4
released is the last versions of this dual tool Linux mockup. It was then
completly rewritten and then released as 1.0.

0.x used an external thumbnailing bash script and gfxindex just created the
HTML files
1.x used imlib to do the image reading and GDK to do the processing and it
was thus the first self contained version of GFXIndex. Everything was done
by the same tool. However by using GDK it required a running X server.
2.x now uses an intenal graphics library and nolonger requires X.
